At one point, I requested an additional milestone, and the team was very forthcoming in acknowledging that the additional work was outside their area of expertise. They even helped me find additional freelancers to support the work. I enjoyed working with Embedai.io and will likely engage them for future projects." },

Initially, the endpoints retrieved were said to include schedulers, but upon closing the contract, it was discovered that not all of them had schedulers. However, the team took responsibility, completed the scrapers, and handed off their work to the internal team taking over the project.While greater availability and more focused attention from the team could have enhanced the project, I understand they have other responsibilitiesâ€”such is life.That said, they demonstrated impressive speed in collecting endpoints, which was very much appreciated."
